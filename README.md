# Hello World, I'm Brandon 👋🏿

Just an engineer messing with stuff...

**A bit about me** 
- ⛴ I have degree in maritime engineering and I've almost circumnavigated the world as an Engineering Officer.
- 🔧 I've worked on gas turbine and diesel ships, made port cranes taller, and kept ice cold at a hockey arena. 
- 🌱 I'm eager to learn all aspects of frontend and backend technologies. 
- 👨🏿‍💻 I'm currently learning <s>GO<s> I mean TS lol
- Need to finish multiple projects
